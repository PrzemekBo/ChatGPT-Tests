write method which return list of strings from another string that start with double dolar signs, 
later contains other characters and ends with double solar signs, and when string will be found will be cut out in java
You can use regular expressions to match the pattern of a string that starts and ends with double dollar signs 
and contains other characters in between. Here's a Java method that uses regular expressions to find
and extract all such strings from a given input string:

java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class StringMatcher {

  public static List<String> findDollarStrings(String input) {
    List<String> matches = new ArrayList<>();
    String pattern = "\\$\\$[^\\$]+\\$\\$";
    Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);
    Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(input);
    int start = 0;
    while (matcher.find(start)) {
      String match = matcher.group();
      matches.add(match);
      start = matcher.end();
    }
    return matches;
  }
}
The findDollarStrings method takes a String input and returns a List of all the strings that match the pattern of 
starting and ending with double dollar signs and containing other characters in between.

The regular expression pattern used in this method is "\\$\\$[^\\$]+\\$\\$", which matches a string that starts with $$
, followed by one or more non-dollar characters, and ends with $$. The [^\\$]+ part matches any character that is not a dollar sign.

The method uses a Matcher object to search for matches of the regular expression in the input string. 
The start variable keeps track of the index in the input string to start searching for the next match after the previous match was found.

Each time a match is found, the method extracts the matching string using the group method of the Matcher object,
 adds it to the matches list, and updates the start variable to the end of the matching string.

Once all matches have been found, the method returns the list of matching strings.
